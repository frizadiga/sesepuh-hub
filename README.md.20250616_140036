## What does Sesepuh Hub do?
- **Multi-LLM support**: Connect to multiple major LLMs like OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and others, so you can interact with them seamlessly.
- **Token streaming support**: Set the environment variable `SESEPUH_HUB_STREAMING=1` to receive responses token by token.
- **Standard interface for LLMs**: Use `sesepuh-hub` as a standardized interface to connect with LLMs, allowing integration with your own tools.

Still in early development, but you can try it out and provide feedback.
